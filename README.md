    $ git clone git@github.com:CNCFlora/sig.git
    $ cd sig
    $ make install-deps
    $ make start

    $ git clone git@github.com:CNCFlora/sig.git
    $ cd sig

The tasks are defined in the Makefile.

At first run, you will need to download the vendor dependencies:

    $ make install-deps # run once to download dependencies

At subsquent, if you wish to update the dependencies:

    $ make update-deps
